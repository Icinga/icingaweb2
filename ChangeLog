### What's New in Version 2.0.0

#### Changes


Upgrading to Icinga Web 2 2.0.0

Icinga Web 2 installations from package on RHEL/CentOS 7 now depend on php-ZendFramework which is available through the EPEL repository. Before, Zend was installed as Icinga Web 2 vendor library through the package icingaweb2-vendor-zend. After upgrading, please make sure to remove the package icingaweb2-vendor-zend.

Icinga Web 2 version 2.0.0 requires permissions for accessing modules. Those permissions are automatically generated for each installed module in the format module/<moduleName>. Administrators have to grant the module permissions to users and/or user groups in the roles configuration for permitting access to specific modules. In addition, restrictions provided by modules are now configurable for each installed module too. Before, a module had to be enabled before having the possibility to configure restrictions.

The instances.ini configuration file provided by the monitoring module has been renamed to commandtransports.ini. The content and location of the file remains unchanged.

The location of a user's preferences has been changed from config-dir/preferences/username.ini to config-dir/preferences/username/config.ini. The content of the file remains unchanged.
